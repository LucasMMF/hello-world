Hello! My name is Lucas, I am a Brazilian Systems Analyst interested in learning more about this wonderful world of development.
I have worked on two projects thus far, completely from start to finish and have done them entirely alone.
But I desire in the future to be a part of a development team, so that I may hone my skills in development even further by learning with others.
I program mainly in Java and Python, but also desire to make works in HTML, CSS, Python and Javascript, as well as a variety of other coding languages.

I'm also way too addicted to Visual Novels, expect lots of references to them. Oh also read Higurashi When They Cry available on Steam.
